# Architecture Proposals

Deepening refactors surfaced by an architecture review on 2026-06-12. Each proposal turns a shallow
module into a deep one: more behaviour behind a smaller interface, with locality (bugs and change
concentrate in one place) and leverage (callers and tests get more per unit of interface) as the
payoff. All evidence verified against the code at time of writing.

## Round 1 — implemented (2026-06-12)

Ordered by leverage:

1. [01-declarative-command-spec.md](01-declarative-command-spec.md) — **Implemented**
   (`8d573510`…`182898b6`, 13 commits): 377/377 commands declare a `CommandSpec`; dispatcher
   derives keys/events/waking/WAL; legacy opt-in methods deleted; registry-wide exhaustiveness
   tests. Found+fixed along the way: MSETEX/BITOP/XGROUP/XREADGROUP WAL bugs, ZINCRBY wake,
   STORE-destination WAL gap (`WalStrategy::Dynamic`).
2. [02-typed-store-access.md](02-typed-store-access.md) — **Implemented** (`e792ed42`,
   `a1a702ca`, `760944d1`, `b8db0087`): `StoreTypedExt` owns the WrongType invariant; unwrap
   chains in commands now 0, enforced by the `lint-no-typed-unwrap` gate (Justfile + lefthook);
   triplicated `get_or_create` + five utils wrappers deleted. Follow-up candidate: extend
   `typed_family_accessors!` to the probabilistic/extension families (tdigest, cuckoo, bloom,
   topk, cms, HLL, timeseries, vectorset, JSON) to retire ~128 remaining
   `as_X().ok_or(WrongType)` read-path sites.
3. [03-unified-post-execution-pipeline.md](03-unified-post-execution-pipeline.md) —
   **Implemented** (`0db27d82`, `bfe61d2e`): `shard/post_execution.rs` owns the canonical
   9-step `WRITE_EFFECT_ORDER`; `WalPhase`/`EffectScope` are data; `pipeline.rs` deleted; each
   effect step invoked from exactly one site; order-invariant regression tests added. (Drift was
   pre-fixed in `6e483280`/`23469adc`.)
4. [04-connection-state-encapsulation.md](04-connection-state-encapsulation.md) —
   **Implemented** (`694ab867`…`470004e7`, 5 commits): `ConnectionState` owns all transitions as
   methods; six state-machine fields now private; external field reach-ins 0 (40+31+6+3+3+3 → 0,
   enforced by the compiler); MULTI five-field reset and the subscribe-limit blocks collapsed to
   one method each; ASKING/LocalServe nuance preserved exactly; 12 socket-free state-machine
   tests. Phase 6 (tracking/auth/blocked fields) intentionally deferred.
5. [05-single-routing-decision.md](05-single-routing-decision.md) — **Implemented** (`510fec8c`):
   dead `CommandRouter`/`RouteResult`/`ScatterStrategy`/`op_to_handler` twin deleted (zero
   non-test callers confirmed); live mapping moved into `router::route_connection_level` +
   `handler_for` as pure functions; `connection_level_handler_for` is now a one-line delegation;
   dead `ConnectionLevelHandler::Cluster` variant removed; reachability + exhaustiveness tests
   added.
6. [06-recovery-orchestrator.md](06-recovery-orchestrator.md) — **Implemented** (`1904d9a8`…
   `b03a8b97`, 6 commits): `server/src/recovery/` owns `recover(RecoveryInputs) ->
   Result<RecoveredState, RecoveryError>` over six ordered phases (checkpoint install, RocksDB
   open, shard restore, functions, replication-state reconcile, cluster storage); `init_persistence`
   + the `PersistenceInitResult` alias deleted; startup collapses to one `recover()` call + wiring.
   11 socket-free seam tests (the staged-checkpoint install path previously had zero). Search-index
   recovery deferred (non-`Send` per-shard handles) — documented at the call site.

## Round 2 — implemented (2026-06-13)

A second deepening review on 2026-06-13 (fresh fan-out over the largest crates, excluding the six
already-implemented refactors). Ordered by leverage:

7. [07-scatter-gather-executor.md](07-scatter-gather-executor.md) — **Implemented**
   (`3d89eb53`…`aedcb3c9`, 5 commits): `scatter/broadcast.rs` owns broadcast fan-out + single-shared-
   deadline timeout + merge behind a `MergeStrategy` seam (`SumIntegers`/`SortedUnion`/`SortedByKey`/
   `DedupSorted`/`CountByKey`/`ShardZeroReply`/`AllOk`/`BoolOr`). Migrated KEYS/DBSIZE/FLUSHDB, TS.*,
   the five PUBSUB introspection commands, SCRIPT LOAD/EXISTS/FLUSH/KILL, and the search fan-outs
   (FT.SEARCH/AGGREGATE/HYBRID/CREATE/ALTER/DROPINDEX/SYNUPDATE/TAGVALS/SPELLCHECK, ES.ALL) via
   per-command `MergeStrategy` impls in `search/merge.rs`; SCAN's cursor walk and RANDOMKEY's
   count-then-fetch borrow the shared `ScatterGather::query_one` per-shard helper. Dead
   `ScatterHandler`/five `merge_*`/`ScanResult` + `KeysStrategy`/`DbSizeStrategy`/`FlushDbStrategy`
   deleted (zero callers reconfirmed). 17 socket-free strategy + mock-shard runner tests (fail-fast/
   best-effort/closed-sender/single-deadline timeout). Fixed round-2 flags F1/F2/F3. Phase 5 (sharing
   folds with the keyed VLL `ScatterGatherStrategy::merge`) deferred — its `HashMap<usize,
   HashMap<Bytes, Response>>` + `key_order` shape resists the sequential-fold `MergeStrategy` model;
   the proposal sanctions leaving the two taxonomies separate rather than contorting the seam.
8. [08-acl-enforcement-seam.md](08-acl-enforcement-seam.md) — **Implemented**
   (`a1bed2be`…`bd2063e6`, 5 commits): `PermissionGuard` seam (`connection/permission_guard.rs`)
   owns the ACL command/key/channel check + denial logging + NOPERM formatting; the four call sites
   (guards/auth/transaction/routing) route through it and the existing acl-crate deep half
   (`FullAclChecker`/`AclError`/`AclLog`); dead `AclChecker` trait + `KeyAccess` enum deleted; 6
   guard unit + 6 ACL integration tests. Fixed round-2 flags: in-MULTI denial logging, NOPERM
   subcommand pipe, ACL DRYRUN key simulation.
9. [09-serialization-typecodec-registry.md](09-serialization-typecodec-registry.md) —
   **Implemented** (`cbb5c4f1`…`048dc792`, 4 commits): serialization dispatches through a
   `TypeCodec` registry keyed by a closed `#[repr(u8)] TypeMarker` whose non-exhaustive `decode_for`
   match makes a missing decode a COMPILE error; wire bytes byte-identical (discriminants pinned,
   payload builders reused); `every_marker_round_trips` covers all 17 markers (9 previously
   untested). Fixed round-2 flags: TimeSeries unknown-policy decode now errors; VectorSet M/EF/dim
   bounds enforced at creation (`types`/`commands`) to match decode → round-trip restored.
10. [10-active-expiry-coordinator.md](10-active-expiry-coordinator.md) — **Implemented**
    (`596ffacc`…`ffdd156f`, 6 commits): `shard/active_expiry.rs` owns
    `ActiveExpiryCoordinator::run_cycle → ExpiryResult`; the event loop calls it +
    `apply_expiry_effects` past the seam; 10 coordinator unit tests + 3 effect tests (no event loop
    needed). Fixed round-2 flags: field-emptied keys now emit `del` + fire the expired probe + count
    in `expired_keys` (no double-count); scan bounded in capped batches so the 25ms budget covers it.
11. [11-probabilistic-typed-accessors.md](11-probabilistic-typed-accessors.md) — **Implemented**
    (`3f3672e5`…`057d9e46`, 13 commits): completes proposal 02's deep module. Split
    `ValueType`/`DefaultValueType` (create-if-missing is now opt-in) and extended
    `typed_family_accessors!` to all 8 probabilistic/extension families (bloom, cuckoo, topk,
    tdigest, cms, hll, timeseries, vectorset), then migrated every hand-rolled
    `as_X().ok_or(WrongType)?` chain to the typed accessors — the 8 families plus the surviving core
    remnants (stream, sorted set, geo, event sourcing, json, string) that proposal 02 left behind.
    `commands/src` is now at **0** `.ok_or(WrongType)` sites; the generic WrongType matrix covers all
    14 families and the no-COW-on-wrong-type property. The `lint-no-typed-unwrap` gate now also bans
    `.ok_or[_else](…WrongType)` so the invariant cannot regress to a second home. Fixed round-2 flags:
    READONLY t-digest clone, core stream `.ok_or(WrongType)` remnants (see below).
12. [12-blocking-wait-coordinator.md](12-blocking-wait-coordinator.md) — **Implemented**
    (`98309ea3`…`db5c6e09`, 5 commits): the wait/wake machinery is concentrated behind two seams.
    Server side, `BlockingWaitCoordinator` (`connection/handlers/blocking/coordinator.rs`) owns the
    response / CLIENT-UNBLOCK / deadline race behind an `UnblockSignal` trait, so `WaitOutcome`
    selection is unit-testable with a mock channel + injected deadline; `WaitOutcome` is now public
    with `into_response(op)`, the single site that chooses the RESP2 nil shape; `handle_blocking_wait`
    collapses to a register→coordinate→cleanup skeleton and `BlockedState` moves behind
    `begin_block`/`end_block`/`blocked_shard` (the last hand-mutated `ConnectionState` field, closing
    proposal 04's Phase 6 holdout). Core side, the three near-parallel `try_satisfy_*_waiters` loops
    collapse into one `drive_satisfaction` driver (FIFO loop, recursive BLMOVE wake-cascade, depth-16
    cap, version bump, metrics, timeout re-validation) behind a `WaiterSatisfaction` strategy
    (List/Zset/Stream) that sees only the store. Dead `ClientHandle::clear_unblock` removed. 8
    socket-free coordinator + strategy/driver unit tests, per-family `*-1`/`$-1` wire-shape
    regression tests, and push-vs-timeout race tests. Fixed round-2 flags: blocking timeout nil shape
    and the lost-element timeout race (see below).
13. [13-column-family-manifest.md](13-column-family-manifest.md) — **Implemented**
    (`ff24a1a4`…`156e7890`, 2 commits): `rocks/manifest.rs` `ColumnFamilyManifest::reconcile` derives
    the required CF set from persisted state and folds the shard-count + warm-tier invariants behind
    one seam; warm on→off reopen is now a hard `WarmTierMismatch` (off→on confirmed benign); a
    `list_cf` failure propagates instead of silently disabling both guards; warm-toggle reopen tests
    cover both directions. Fixed round-2 flags: warm-tier toggle, `list_cf` swallow.

## Round 3 — implemented (2026-06-15)

A third deepening review on 2026-06-15 (fresh fan-out over the crates rounds 1-2 left untouched:
replication, cluster, scripting, search internals, vll/config/telemetry/eviction). Ordered by
leverage:

14. [14-replication-backlog.md](14-replication-backlog.md) — **Implemented**
    (`4daa18ab`…`aed8d0dd`, 6 commits): `primary/replay.rs` `PartialSyncReplay` owns ring-buffer
    lifecycle + `can_replay` + `extract_backlog` behind `handle_partial_sync_request`; `handle_psync`
    routes through it and grants `+CONTINUE` end-to-end (the `partial_sync_replay_supported` gate is
    deleted); lower-bound eviction + replid-mismatch fall back to full resync. Built on proposal 18's
    offset contract. Fixed round-2/round-3 flags: F1 full-sync handoff data loss + F2 `+CONTINUE`
    gap, both via a gap-free streamer (subscribe-before-cut + backlog replay of
    `(snapshot_offset, current]` with live-tail dedup). 90 unit + 122 integration tests.
15. [15-search-index-lifecycle.md](15-search-index-lifecycle.md) — **Implemented**
    (`b23319c0`…`135127e1`, 5 commits): `core/shard/search/lifecycle.rs` `IndexLifecycleManager` owns
    create/drop/alter/info/recover behind one seam; `shards.rs` inline recovery (~90 lines) deleted →
    `IndexLifecycleManager::recover` at worker-spawn time (subsumes proposal 06's deferred item), with
    a `RecoveryOutcome::{Corrupt,Undeserializable}` taxonomy instead of a silent `warn!`. Fixed flags:
    FT.CREATE/ALTER/DROPINDEX now persist-before-OK (roll back + error on persist/commit failure).
    10 lifecycle unit tests; search 146 + server-search 136 + regression 120.
16. [16-config-parameter-lifecycle.md](16-config-parameter-lifecycle.md) — **Implemented**
    (`699f85f4`…`ae5527d4`, 7 commits): `ConfigParam<T>` + type-erased `DynParam` registry; all **45
    mutable params** on the typed lifecycle (31 `ConfigParam` + 14 `NoopParam`, enforced by
    `test_param_registry_consistency`); inline legacy setters deleted; shard propagation now driven
    from param defs. Fixed flags: eviction-policy / durability-mode / wal-failure-policy / loglevel
    legal-value lists deduped onto enum/const sources of truth; `build_eviction_config` failure mode
    unified. (`params.rs` metadata registry stays config-side — docs-gen needs it; sanctioned.)
    config 94 + server-config 82.
17. [17-cluster-redirect-mapper.md](17-cluster-redirect-mapper.md) — **Implemented**
    (`bfb49b6a`…`736a4115`, 4 commits): `slot_migration/redirect.rs` + `RouteDecision::to_response`
    own all MOVED/ASK/CLUSTERDOWN construction; the redirect literals now live only there. SSUBSCRIBE
    routed through `coordinator.route()`; `cluster_pubsub::get_slot_owner_addr` deleted. Fixed flags:
    SSUBSCRIBE migration misroute (importing+ASKING serves local, ASK emitted, unassigned→CLUSTERDOWN),
    MOVED IPv6 bracketing, `slot_assignment.get` reach-ins. 166 cluster+pubsub + 58 regression.
    (Distinct from proposal 05, which was connection-level handler selection.)
18. [18-replication-offset-coordinator.md](18-replication-offset-coordinator.md) — **Implemented**
    (`ec025b14`…`944e8882`, 4 commits): `offset_coordinator.rs` `OffsetCoordinator` owns all three
    offset homes behind one seam (`frame_advance`/`advance_broadcast`/`current`/`min_acked`/
    `record_replica_ack`/`can_serve_partial_sync`/`reconcile_for_persist`); readers + writers routed,
    dead writer deleted. Fixed the 🔴 offset-increment mismatch (replica now counts payload only via
    `frame_advance`, matching the primary) + GETACK offset-0 (now advanced+stamped+backlogged).
    Proposal 14 builds on this. 75 unit + 119 integration.
19. [19-vector-field-state-manager.md](19-vector-field-state-manager.md) — **Implemented**
    (`1b77ab64`…`77349ebf`, 4 commits): `search/src/vector.rs` `VectorFieldManager` owns the 4 maps
    behind high-level ops with the bijection invariant + all-or-nothing index/delete. Fixed flags:
    discarded `usearch.add`/`remove` results, replace-path `key_map` orphan, `create_vector_indexes`
    id-collision on partial load (now both-or-neither `try_load`), non-atomic `save_vectors` (now
    temp+fsync+rename). search 146 + vectorset/vsim/vadd 98.
20. [20-eviction-generic-ranker.md](20-eviction-generic-ranker.md) — **Implemented**
    (`6ba518c3`…`01cd1bda`, 5 commits): `eviction/ranker.rs` `EvictionRanker` (3 `#[inline]` ZST
    rankers) collapses the 9 triplicated bodies to one `sample_with_ranker`/`evict_with_ranker`/
    `demote_with_ranker` + one `maybe_insert_with_ranker`; monomorphized (no dyn dispatch),
    bit-identical selection (verified by transitional parity tests). Fixed flag:
    `frogdb_eviction_samples_total` now carries the `policy` label. core 587 + maxmemory regression 59.

## Correctness flags found during the review

Bugs adjacent to (but separable from) the proposals:

- **Replication offset never persisted after startup** — ~~tracker only updates an `AtomicU64`;
  staged `replication_metadata.json` has no reader~~ Fixed in `17f01c9d` (primary saves at
  shutdown + pre-snapshot hook; replica reconciles from staged metadata; corrupt/missing →
  full resync).
- **Partial resync never granted; checkpoints record offset 0** — ~~stale
  `state.replication_offset` read by FULLRESYNC/`can_partial_sync`~~ Fixed in `64f15bce`
  (offset captured from tracker before checkpoint cut; offset ≤ data invariant).
- **No replication backlog — partial resync structurally ungrantable** — `+CONTINUE` would tail
  the live broadcast only, silently dropping `(requested, current]`. Gated explicitly behind
  `partial_sync_replay_supported()` (false). Implementing a backlog ring buffer (Redis
  `repl-backlog`) is the unlock; the split-brain `ReplicationRingBuffer` is a separate mechanism.
- **INFO replication `master_replid` reports zeros** — ~~built from `ctx.node_id` instead of the
  real replication id~~ Fixed in `99c8f91e` (`handle_info` patches from the shared
  `ReplicationState`). `master_replid2`/`second_repl_offset` remain `0`/`-1` — no
  failover-continuity (replid2) concept yet; needed only when partial resync across failover
  becomes possible (see backlog flag above).
- **Shard-count mismatch silently drops recovered data** — ~~`server/src/server/shards.rs:60`
  uses `unwrap_or_default()`~~ Fixed in `95da0256` (hard startup error at `RocksStore::open`,
  persisted count derived from `shard_*` column families).
- **Warm-tier toggle breaks reopen** — ~~data dir created with warm tier enabled fails to reopen
  with it disabled (`tiered_warm_*` CFs not reopened → RocksDB "column families not opened")~~ Fixed
  in `ff24a1a4` (hard `WarmTierMismatch` error; see proposal 13). Config toggling on→off is
  rejected; off→on is a benign first-enable.
- **Missing command behaviors** — LREM emits no keyspace event; RPOPLPUSH/LMOVE never wake blocked
  list waiters; GEORADIUS STORE destination key not extracted (see proposal 01).
- **Post-execution drift** — transaction path skips keyspace metrics and keysizes flush; scatter
  BCAST tracking invalidation omitted (see proposal 03).
- **Checkpoint staging untested** — ~~zero tests~~ Fixed in `165fc950` (8 tests: happy path,
  crash windows, idempotency, partial states). Testing found a real bug, fixed in `3e37ad7b`:
  an incomplete staged dir (no `CURRENT`) was installed anyway — live DB moved aside, fresh
  empty DB created in its place. Install now validates before touching the live dir.
- **STORE-destination WAL gap** — ~~arg-index WAL actions miss GEORADIUS/SORT STORE
  destinations~~ Fixed in `fc0dce48` (`WalStrategy::Dynamic` resolves from the command's own key
  extraction; restart-survival tests). Same-class WAL bugs also fixed: MSETEX, BITOP, XGROUP,
  XREADGROUP persisted a non-key arg or nothing. ZINCRBY waiter wake fixed in `182898b6`.
- **Missing command behaviors — class closed** — proposal 01 implemented (13 commits,
  `8d573510`…`182898b6`): 377/377 commands declare a `CommandSpec`; registry-wide exhaustiveness
  tests make silent event/WAL/wake omissions unrepresentable.
- **Cross-shard keyspace notifications lost** — SUBSCRIBE registers on shard 0 (broadcast
  coordinator) but keyspace events emit on the key-owner shard; in multi-shard mode a keyevent for
  a key not on shard 0 never reaches the subscriber.
- **Keyspace hit/miss misclassification** — ~~`track_keyspace_metrics` classifies via
  `Response::Null`, but GET/HGET misses return `Response::Bulk(None)`~~ Fixed in `23469adc`
  (lookup-level classification via `CommandContext::record_keyspace_lookup`).
- **INFO stats hardcodes `keyspace_hits:0` / `keyspace_misses:0`** — ~~never wired to the real
  counters~~ Fixed in `02de350b` (`handle_info` patches from the Prometheus registry).
- **CONFIG RESETSTAT doesn't reset keyspace_hits/misses** — Redis zeroes them; FrogDB's are
  Prometheus monotonic counters (reset would break `rate()`/`increase()` semantics). Needs a
  design decision (baseline-offset vs registry recreation) — deliberate divergence for now.
- **Keyspace-stats command coverage gap** — only GET/HGET/LINDEX/GETDEL/GETEX/MGET report
  lookups; Redis counts most read commands (LRANGE, SMEMBERS, ZRANGE, …). Enhancement, not a bug.

### Round 2 flags (2026-06-13)

Found while writing proposals 07-13. All verified against the code; grouped by proposal.

- **Broadcast gathers have no timeout (proposal 07)** — ~~PUBSUB CHANNELS/NUMSUB/NUMPAT/SHARDCHANNELS/
  SHARDNUMSUB (`handlers/pubsub.rs:456,492,528,562,598`) and SCRIPT LOAD/EXISTS/FLUSH/KILL
  (`handlers/scripting/script.rs:76,120,133`) gather with a bare `rx.await` — unlike every
  `scatter.rs` handler, which wraps a `tokio::time::timeout`. A stalled internal shard hangs the
  connection forever. Send failures are also swallowed (`let _ = sender.send`), so a dropped shard
  silently under-reports.~~ Fixed in `d5b8de0d` (all routed through `ScatterGather::run`'s single
  shared deadline; `FailFast` errors instead of under-reporting; SCRIPT KILL keeps its sequential
  walk but its per-shard await is now timeout-bounded).
- **SCRIPT LOAD can diverge the per-shard Lua cache (proposal 07)** — ~~`handlers/scripting/script.rs:34-54`
  ignores all per-shard send results and awaits only shard 0, returning a SHA while other internal
  shards may never have received the script → EVALSHA can fail on some shards after a slow/dropped
  send.~~ Fixed in `d5b8de0d` (`ShardZeroReply` over `FailFast` requires every shard to ack before
  the SHA is returned).
- **Dead scatter code (proposal 07)** — ~~`handlers/scatter.rs:714-844` (`ScatterHandler`, five
  `merge_*`, `ScanResult`) and `scatter/strategies.rs:304-462` (`KeysStrategy`/`DbSizeStrategy`/
  `FlushDbStrategy`) have zero callers; tested copies of merge logic that diverge from the live
  inline versions. Delete in Phase 1.~~ Fixed in `dd892fc5` (deleted; zero callers reconfirmed).
- **In-transaction ACL denials skip the audit log (proposal 08, SECURITY)** — ~~queue-time key
  denials (`handlers/transaction.rs:458-462`) and channel denials (`:473-488`) return NOPERM but
  never call `log_key_denied`/`log_channel_denied`, unlike the live paths (`routing.rs:66`,
  `guards.rs:113`). EXEC does not recheck, so in-MULTI denials never reach `ACL LOG`.~~ Fixed in
  `d1d871a6` (queue-time key + channel checks route through `PermissionGuard`, so denials hit
  `ACL LOG` identically to the live paths).
- **NOPERM subcommand message uses a space, not a pipe (proposal 08)** — ~~`guards.rs:204` formats
  the error as `'config set'`; the same function logs it as `config|set` (`:181`) and
  `AclError::NoPermissionSubcommand` uses a pipe. Diverges from Redis.~~ Fixed in `a1bed2be` +
  `d1d871a6` (reply built from `AclError` Display over the lowercase fullname → `config|set`).
- **ACL DRYRUN mis-simulates key access (proposal 08)** — ~~`handlers/auth.rs:458-468` uses a
  heuristic (first arg only, always `ReadWrite`) instead of `handler.keys()` +
  `key_access_type_for_flags`. Mis-reports read-only commands, multi-key commands, and commands
  whose key isn't arg 0; the audit tool disagrees with real enforcement.~~ Fixed in `4854d00b`
  (uses the command's real key spec + `key_access_type_for_flags`).
- **VectorSet encode/decode bound asymmetry (proposal 09)** — ~~`serialization/search.rs:117-134`
  decode rejects `m>512`, `ef>4096`, `dim>65536`, but `VADD` parses `M`/`EF` with unbounded
  `parse_usize` (`vectorset/vadd.rs:135,161`) and `VectorSetValue::new_inner` applies no cap. A set
  created with e.g. `M 1000` serializes fine but fails to load on restart/replica full-sync →
  silent key loss.~~ Reproduced (usearch applies no clamp) and fixed in `048dc792`: `MAX_DIM`/
  `MAX_CONNECTIVITY`/`MAX_EF` enforced at the creation choke points (`new_inner`/`from_parts` + a
  VADD REDUCE guard); decode references the same consts (single source of truth) → round-trip
  invariant restored, oversized sets rejected at creation.
- **TimeSeries decode coerces unknown DuplicatePolicy to `Last` (proposal 09)** — ~~`serialization/
  timeseries.rs:96-104` catch-all `_ => DuplicatePolicy::Last`, unlike every other enum decode
  (which errors)~~ Fixed in `5b37cbbf` (unknown byte → `SerializationError::InvalidPayload`).
- **READONLY t-digest queries clone the digest on every call (proposal 11)** — ~~TDIGEST.QUANTILE/
  CDF/RANK/REVRANK/TRIMMED_MEAN (`tdigest.rs:364,408,450,494,660`) are flagged `READONLY`/`wal:
  NoOp` but call `get_mut` + `as_tdigest_mut` and invoke only read methods → copy-on-write clone of
  a shared digest on every query. Migrating to the read accessor removes the clone. (Same COW-before-
  check class affects ~19 write-path probabilistic sites; see proposal 11 Class A.)~~ Fixed in
  `2e7da3a4` (the five query methods actually mutated via lazy `flush()`, so they were made `&self` —
  flushing a local copy only when the unmerged buffer is non-empty, numeric results identical — and
  the commands now use the read accessor `get_tdigest(key)?` with no `get_mut`; the ~19 write-path
  Class-A sites were fixed across the per-family migrations).
- **Core stream files still carry `.ok_or(WrongType)` remnants (proposal 11)** — ~~proposal 02 killed
  the `.unwrap()` form but never banned `.ok_or`, so ~19 `as_*_mut().ok_or(WrongType)` survive in
  `commands/src/stream/*`. Fold into proposal 11 Phase 1 before the gate extension can go green.~~
  Fixed in `b53419d8` (all stream remnants migrated to `get_stream`/`get_stream_mut`; the wider sweep
  also cleared the sorted-set/geo/event-sourcing/json/string remnants in `a8276e50`/`c4185b62`, so
  the extended gate is green at 0 sites).
- **Active expiry: field-emptied key deletion is silent and under-counted (proposal 10)** — ~~when a
  hash is emptied by `purge_expired_hash_fields` and the key is deleted (`event_loop.rs:207-214`),
  the branch skips `emit_keyspace_notification` + `fire_key_expired` (unlike the key-level path at
  `:165-171`) and feeds only `frogdb_fields_expired_total`, not `expired_keys` (`:218-237`)~~ Fixed
  in `911b2525` (emit `del` + fire the expired probe for field-emptied keys) + `6017333e` (count
  them in `expired_keys` via `ExpiryResult::keys_expired()`, no double-count with the field counter).
- **Active expiry time budget excludes the scan (proposal 10)** — ~~`get_expired_keys`/
  `get_expired_fields` clone every due entry into a `Vec` up front (`store/noop.rs:99-112,223-233`)
  before the 25ms budgeted loop (`event_loop.rs:138`), so a large TTL avalanche can stall the shard
  event loop past budget~~ Fixed in `ffdd156f` (bounded `get_expired_*_limited`; `run_cycle` scans
  in capped batches with the budget re-checked between/within batches).
- **Blocking timeout returns the wrong RESP2 nil shape (proposal 12)** — ~~the timeout/channel-drop
  paths emit `Response::Null` (`$-1`) for every op (`handlers/blocking.rs:157,170,125,130`; shard
  `core/src/shard/blocking.rs:149`), but BLPOP/BRPOP/BLMPOP/BZPOPMIN/BZPOPMAX/BZMPOP/XREAD return a
  null *array* (`*-1`, `Response::NullArray` exists at `protocol/response.rs:162`) in RESP2. The
  timeout path discards the op so it can't pick the shape. RESP3 unaffected; BLMOVE/BRPOPLPUSH
  correctly want `$-1`.~~ Fixed in `98309ea3` (`BlockingOp::timeout_reply()` is the single audited
  nil-shape site; the shard's coarse safety-net calls it) + `40e88bcb` (`WaitOutcome::into_response`
  threads the op through the server timeout/unblock arms so the precise reply picks the shape; per-
  family `*-1`/`$-1` wire-shape regression tests over a raw RESP2 socket).
- **Blocking lost-element timeout race (proposal 12)** — ~~two independent timeout authorities (server
  `select!` vs shard's 100ms `check_waiter_timeouts`, `event_loop.rs:23`). If a push is processed by
  the shard before the server's `UnregisterWait` arrives, `complete_blocked_waiter`
  (`core/src/shard/blocking.rs:665-672`) pops the list element and sends it into the abandoned
  oneshot after the server already returned a timeout nil → element removed from the store, delivered
  to nobody. Narrow but genuine data loss.~~ Fixed in `733e4d67` (the server is now the single
  timeout authority; the shard re-validates every popped waiter in `drive_satisfaction` and drops any
  whose deadline has elapsed or whose receiver is gone *without* consuming store data. The shard
  reads the clock strictly before it pops and the coordinator's `biased` select favours a delivered
  response over a simultaneous deadline, so every popped element is guaranteed to reach a still-
  waiting receiver; `check_waiter_timeouts` is demoted to a coarse GC that never consumes data.
  Concurrency tests reproduce the race (push vs dropped receiver, push vs elapsed deadline)).
- **Warm-tier toggle breaks reopen (proposal 13)** — ~~`rocks/mod.rs:74-88` derives `all_cf_names`
  from the current `warm_enabled`; created-with-warm then reopened-without skips `tiered_warm_*` CFs
  → open fails at `:126-134` with "Column families not opened". (Inverse off→on is benign — `create_cf`
  is guarded at `:136`, correcting the original "duplicate CFs" hypothesis.)~~ Fixed in `ff24a1a4`
  (hard `WarmTierMismatch` on→off; off→on benign; both directions tested) and folded into
  `ColumnFamilyManifest::reconcile` (`156e7890`).
- **`list_cf(...).unwrap_or_default()` silently disables both reopen guards (proposal 13)** —
  ~~`rocks/mod.rs:91`: a failed CF enumeration (transient I/O, permissions, damaged MANIFEST) yields
  an empty `existing_cfs` even when the DB exists, bypassing the shard-count guard
  (`count_persisted_shards(&[]) == 0`) and building an empty descriptor set → confusing open failure
  instead of an actionable error~~ Fixed in `ff24a1a4` (the `list_cf` error propagates as a named
  `RocksError`).

### Round 3 flags (2026-06-15)

Found while writing proposals 14-20; grouped by proposal. The two 🔴 replication bugs were
independently verified against the source.

- 🔴 **Replication offset increment mismatch (proposal 18) — CONFIRMED** — ~~the primary advances the
  offset by RESP **payload** bytes (`primary/mod.rs:271-272`, `bytes_len = resp_bytes.len()`) but the
  replica advances by the **full frame** including the 18-byte header (`replica/streaming.rs:32`,
  `frame.encoded_size()` = `FRAME_HEADER_SIZE(18) + payload`). Primary and replica count the offset
  in different units → the replica drifts ahead 18 bytes/frame, breaking ACK comparison, saturating
  `replica_lag` to 0, letting WAIT succeed before data arrives, and falsely rejecting a caught-up
  replica from any future partial-sync window.~~ Fixed in `944e8882` (replica advances by
  `OffsetCoordinator::frame_advance` = `frame.payload.len()`, the one shared unit).
- 🔴 **Full-sync handoff drops writes during checkpoint transfer (proposal 14) — CONFIRMED** —
  ~~`handle_full` captures `snapshot_offset`, cuts + streams the whole checkpoint, and only then
  (`start_streaming`) calls `wal_broadcast.subscribe()`. `broadcast::subscribe()` delivers only future
  frames, so writes in the window between the checkpoint cut and the subscribe are in neither the
  checkpoint nor the live stream → silently lost on full-sync under write load.~~ Fixed in `312f57fb`
  (gap-free handoff: subscribe BEFORE reading the head, replay `(snapshot_offset, current]` from the
  backlog, then forward the live tail skipping `sequence <= resume_offset`; deterministic
  writes-during-fullsync no-loss test in `89f54074`).
- **REPLCONF GETACK built with offset 0 (proposal 18)** — ~~`request_acks` builds the frame with
  sequence `0` instead of the current offset, and bypasses `broadcast_command` so it doesn't advance
  the primary offset while the replica counts it~~ Fixed in `944e8882` (GETACK now advances + stamps +
  backlogs like any stream command, so both ends agree).
- **Dead second offset writer (proposal 18)** — ~~`PrimaryReplicationHandler::increment_offset`
  updates both state and tracker but has no callers; the live path touches only the tracker~~ Removed
  in `1b61649a` (the coordinator owns the contract).
- **FT.CREATE / FT.ALTER / FT.DROPINDEX persistence failures return OK then lose state on restart
  (proposal 15)** — ~~create-persist + initial-scan-commit failures swallowed → OK; alter commit +
  persist failures swallowed → OK (schema reverts on restart); drop meta-delete failure leaves
  metadata (restart resurrects an empty index); and recovery silently skips a corrupt/undeserializable
  index with only a `warn!`~~ Fixed in `38258ea5` (persist-before-OK: create/alter/drop roll back +
  error on persist/commit failure) + `d041912e` (recovery returns a
  `RecoveryOutcome::{Corrupt,Undeserializable}` taxonomy; CF-read failure is fatal).
- **SSUBSCRIBE bypasses migration routing (proposal 17)** — ~~`cluster_pubsub::get_slot_owner_addr`,
  consumed at `handlers/pubsub.rs`, decides redirects from slot ownership alone: importing-target +
  ASKING returns MOVED instead of serving locally, never emits ASK, and an *unassigned* slot
  subscribes locally instead of CLUSTERDOWN~~ Fixed in `92bfc083` (SSUBSCRIBE routes through
  `coordinator.route()` → `RouteDecision::to_response`; `get_slot_owner_addr` deleted in `736a4115`).
- **MOVED format drift, IPv6 (proposal 17)** — ~~`guards.rs` formats `MOVED {slot} {ip}:{port}` while
  `pubsub.rs` uses `MOVED {slot} {SocketAddr}` → divergent for IPv6; plus direct `slot_assignment.get`
  reach-ins bypassing the `get_slot_owner` accessor~~ Fixed in `bfb49b6a`/`736a4115` (the
  `slot_migration/redirect.rs` seam is the single authoritative formatter — IPv6 bracketed; reach-ins
  routed through `get_slot_owner`).
- **Vector field-state desync (proposal 19)** — ~~`index_vector` discards the `usearch.add` result yet
  inserts into the maps; the replace path overwrites `reverse_map` but never removes
  `vector_key_map[old_id]`; `delete_vector` discards `usearch.remove`; and `create_vector_indexes`
  loads the usearch file and `_map.json` independently → on partial load `vector_next_id` resets to 0
  while usearch keeps ids, causing id-collisions returning the wrong key; `save_vectors` writes the two
  sidecars non-atomically~~ Fixed in `7cf34fd5` (bijection + all-or-nothing index/delete, propagated
  add/remove results) + `77349ebf` (`try_load` both-or-neither, temp+fsync+rename save) — all in the
  `VectorFieldManager`.
- **Config validation duplicated (proposals 16 / 20)** — ~~the valid eviction-policy list is hardcoded
  in CONFIG SET, again in `MemoryConfig::validate`, and a third time via `EvictionPolicy::FromStr`;
  `build_eviction_config` `unreachable!()`s on parse failure while `notify_eviction_change` silently
  falls back to `NoEviction` (divergent); `durability-mode`/`wal-failure-policy` lists duplicated
  between setters and `PersistenceConfig::validate`; shard propagation keyed off a hardcoded
  `eviction_params` name list~~ Fixed across proposal 16: legal-value lists deduped onto enum/const
  sources of truth (`ef8a092f`/`70656956`/`ccf01e13`), `build_eviction_config` failure mode unified
  (`ef8a092f`), shard propagation driven from param defs (`eb4e29e9`).
- **Eviction sample metric missing `policy` label (proposal 20)** — ~~`frogdb_eviction_samples_total`
  is incremented with only a `shard` label in all three samplers, unlike sibling eviction metrics that
  carry `policy`~~ Fixed in `01cd1bda` (the single `sample_with_ranker` increment now carries
  `policy`).
