//! The connection-command seam (core-side definition).
//!
//! A [`ConnectionCommand`] executes against a narrow [`ConnCtx`] view of the
//! connection — only the subsystems it declares — instead of taking
//! `&ConnectionHandler` (a large god object in the server crate). This is the
//! target shape for the connection-level command tree: it collapses the "spec
//! stub in a command module, logic as a method on `ConnectionHandler`" split
//! into one self-contained unit whose interface is its `ConnCtx`.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `core`
//!
//! The command registry ([`crate::registry`]) stores one executor per command
//! as a [`crate::registry::CommandImpl`] tagged union. For the registry to name
//! the connection executor as `CommandImpl::Connection(&'static dyn
//! ConnectionCommand)`, the trait must be defined in `core` (the server crate
//! cannot be named by `core`). The only server-specific dependency the original
//! `ConnCtx` had — the `ConfigManager` — is abstracted here behind the
//! [`ConfigProvider`] trait, which the server's `ConfigManager` implements.
//!
//! The trait is object-safe: `execute` returns a boxed future rather than being
//! an `async fn`, so a command can be stored and dispatched as `&'static dyn
//! ConnectionCommand` from the registry.
